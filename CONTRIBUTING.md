# Contributing to Gov Icons

If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.

## Quick start

We only accept issues that are icon requests, bug reports, or feature requests.
Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Gov Icons framework.

* [Request a new icon](https://github.com/540co/govicons/issues/new?title=Icon%20request:%20icon-name&template=icon-request.md)
* [Submit a bug report](https://github.com/540co/govicons/issues/new?template=bug-report.md)

## Requesting new icons

- Title your new issue Icon request: icon-name (e.g., Icon request: icon-drone).
- Include a few use cases for your requested icon. How do you plan on using it?

## Key branches

- `master` is the latest, deployed version

## Pull requests

- At the moment we are not accepting pull requests containing icons
- Try to share which browsers your code has been tested in before submitting a pull request
